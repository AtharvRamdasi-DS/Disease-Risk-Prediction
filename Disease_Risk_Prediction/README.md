# Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project is about predicting whether a person is at risk of diabetes based on medical details like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.
The main objective is to understand how machine learning models can be used in healthcare to identify disease risk at an early stage.
In this project, I compared two machine learning models:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Dataset Information

- Dataset Name: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Target Column: Outcome

## Outcome values:

- 0 means the person does not have diabetes
- 1 means the person has diabetes

## Tools and Technologies used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Colab

## Steps followed in project

1. Loaded the dataset and understood the data
2. Handled missing values where medical values were incorrectly recorded as
